=== Ansible Tower

Whilst a significant component of the Lab will be using a collection, `awx.awx` to configure Ansible Tower you *do not* actually need to access the Web UI.
However you use the Ansible Tower Console to visually check your work and validate your playbook is working correctly.

Like *Visual Studio Code* this section is entirely optional.

In this section, you will explore RedHat Ansible Tower Web UI and it's components.

. Use the public IP address or DNS name to access the `tower` node.

. Access link:https://tower.{GUID}.{OSP_DOMAIN}[Ansible Tower]

. Sign in to the Ansible Tower web UI as an administrator using the *{TOWER_ADMIN_USER}*
account and *{TOWER_ADMIN_PASSWORD}* as the password.
+
Open browser and type *{TOWER_URL}*
+
